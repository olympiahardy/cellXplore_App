# What is cellXplore?

Here we present **cellXplore** an interactive visualisation platform that allows exploratory analysis of CCI localised within its native context with no prior computational skills required. 

The primary aim of cellXplore is to provide a shared platform streamlining the downstream visualisation of pre-computed cell-cell interactions inferred from scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data. Through allowing the development of customisable interactive data visualisations, we empower the user to interrogate their data and draw biological conclusions thus bridging the gap between biologist and programmer. 

cellXplore allows for filtering and in-depth examination of L-R pairs of interest, visualisation of selected L-R pairs at the transcriptomic level then followed by validation within their spatial context. Lastly, users can export results through multiple visualisation options and formats ensuring reducibility and application for publications.
