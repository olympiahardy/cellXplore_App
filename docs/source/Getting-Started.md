# Getting Started
cellXplore requires a fully pre-processed object containing ligand-receptor information from their single-cell data that can be generated from supported packages such as CellPhoneDB, CellChat and NicheNetR. Currently it is optimised to be compatible with LIANA+ that provides wrapper functions in Python for the above mentioned interaction packages. 

Here we will demonstrate the functionality of cellXplore on a Breast Cancer dataset that has patient matched single-cell transcriptomic data and 10X Xenium data. You can read more about the dataset here:
